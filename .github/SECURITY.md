# Security Configuration for GitHub Copilot Workflows

## Overview

The GitHub Actions workflows in this repository have been configured to follow security best practices:

## Security Improvements

### 1. Credential Management
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords in workflow files
- ✅ Database passwords use GitHub repository secrets
- ✅ Fallback to secure defaults for development environments
- ✅ Environment variables used instead of inline credentials

### 2. Permissions
- ✅ Workflows use minimal required permissions (`contents: read`)
- ✅ No excessive permissions granted to workflow jobs

### 3. Logging Security
- ✅ Database URLs with credentials are not logged in plain text
- ✅ Step summaries avoid exposing sensitive connection strings
- ✅ Only database names and configuration details are logged

### 4. DevContainer Security
- ✅ DevContainer uses environment variables for credentials
- ✅ Support for `.env` file for local development
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in docker-compose configuration

## Configuration for Production Use

### GitHub Repository Secrets

Set up the following secrets in your repository settings:

1. **POSTGRES_PASSWORD** (optional)
   - Custom PostgreSQL password for workflows
   - If not set, defaults to 'postgres' for development use
   - Recommended for any production or shared environments

### Environment Variables

The workflows support these environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username (default: 'postgres')
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password (from secrets or default: 'postgres')
- `RAILS_ENV`: Rails environment (default: 'development')

## Development Setup

For local development with devcontainer:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Modify credentials as needed
3. The devcontainer will use your custom values

## Security Compliance

These workflows follow GitHub Advanced Security best practices:

- ✅ No secrets hardcoded in source code
- ✅ Minimal workflow permissions
- ✅ Secure credential management
- ✅ No credential exposure in logs
- ✅ Environment variable parameterization
- ✅ Default secure configurations

## Monitoring and Alerts

GitHub Advanced Security will monitor these workflows for:
- Hardcoded credentials
- Exposed secrets in logs
- Excessive workflow permissions
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
